## General Notes
When errors are displayed, they have the following format:
> ERROR: (Error Text)  
> ERROR: ----------  
> ERROR: (Extra Error Text)

This text will be displayed on exit if any errors marked with an asterisk (\*) occur:
>
> One or more errors were encountered that could be caused by any one of a variety of factors, including (but not limited to) antivirus interference, failing/unstable hardware, or a lack of free space available on the drive.  
>
> Please try the script again to confirm any issues are repeatable, then report any recurring errors on the Nexus Mods mod page (<https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/57782>) or the GitHub project (<https://github.com/rux616/biraitbec-workbase-improved>). When you do so, please also upload the "install.current.log" file in the "`$(($dir.Logs).Split("\")[-1])`" folder to a website like TextUploader.com (<https://textuploader.com/>) or Pastebin (<https://pastebin.com/>), and include the link.

In this case, they did not match.
